An AI assistant mix between Copilot and Spotlight written in Rust.

## About

[Tenjin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenjin_(kami)) is a pet project for preparing an AI powered assistant similar to Alfred or MacOS Spotlight but with a software engineering focus.  

I aim to integrate similar features to Copilot into the software while having it at your fingertips and IDE agnostic.

_Tenjin is a learning project aimed at teaching myself UI in Rust._
